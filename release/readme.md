## Github release

[ once bump version & changes PRs merged ]

* create a release (or prerelease if intermediate release) draft on github based on your tag (https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/new)
* Make sure the repository is in the correct state: `git switch --detach <tag>`
* launch docker using the Docker GUI macOS app
* generate opam artifacts, using `release/release.sh <tag>` from a macOS/arm64 machine, it requires to have Docker and QEMU installed (see below device requirements)
* generate the signatures using `release/sign.sh <tag>`
* add releases notes (content of `master_changes.md`) in the release draft
* upload everything from `release/out/<tag>`
* finalise the release (publish)

## Publish the release

* add hashes in `install.sh` (and check signatures)
* `opam publish --exclude=opam,opam-admin https://github.com/ocaml/opam/archive/refs/tags/<tag>.tar.gz`
  (and add `flags: avoid-version` and `available: opam-version >= "2.1.0"` to each packages if this is not a stable version)
* update versions (and messages, if necessary) in https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/repo
